### Troubleshooting

Adruino Nano and MacOS. Some Chinese versions of this board may have CH34x chipset installed. It means that it may not work correctly with default drivers.

I used [this way](https://github.com/adrianmihalko/ch340g-ch34g-ch34x-mac-os-x-driver#installation-with-homebrew-cask) to make it work. Addition information can be found [here](http://blog.sebastian-martens.de/technology/connecting-arduino-nano-to-mac-os-x/).
